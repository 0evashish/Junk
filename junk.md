**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A plan for cross-training methods documented to promote collaborative knowledge-sharing practices within the team.
- Methods such as pairing, mobbing, or swarming evaluated and selected based on suitability for team dynamics and project requirements.
- Story selection guidelines established to determine which types of tasks are best suited for the chosen collaboration methods.
- Accountability measures documented to track team progress, pivoting strategies identified to adapt to better-suited methods as necessary.
- Impact assessment conducted to evaluate how the chosen method affects current productivity and committed timelines.
- Documentation reviewed and refined with input from multiple team members to ensure the plan aligns with team objectives and operational efficiency.

### **1. Pairing**

**Definition:**  
Pair programming involves two developers working together at one workstation. One acts as the "driver," writing the code, while the other acts as the "observer" or "navigator," reviewing each line as itâ€™s written.

**Best suited for:**

- Tasks that require precision or critical business logic, such as resolving high-severity production issues or complex bug fixes.
- Training and mentoring less-experienced developers.
- Implementing complex new features where close collaboration improves code quality.

**Recommendation for your environment:**

- **CCBS/CCDS agile squads:** Ideal for complex production support tickets when new team members are on rotation.
- **Platform team:** Can be used when developing core frameworks or critical modules.

---
### **2. Mobbing**

**Definition:**  
Mobbing involves the entire team (or a significant group) working on a single problem simultaneously, often sharing one screen.

**Best suited for:**

- Tasks that require brainstorming or multiple perspectives, such as architectural decisions.
- Troubleshooting high-priority production outages.
- Knowledge-sharing exercises for cross-functional learning.

**Recommendation for your environment:**

- **CCBS/CCDS agile squads:** Use mobbing during major production outages to gather perspectives quickly and find a resolution.
- **Platform team:** Effective for collaborative design discussions or technical spikes requiring diverse expertise.

---
### **3. Swarming**

**Definition:**  
Swarming occurs when multiple team members come together to work on different aspects of the same task or story simultaneously but independently.

**Best suited for:**

- High-priority, time-sensitive tasks where splitting work can expedite delivery.
- Complex features that require different skill sets (frontend, backend, testing).
- Collaborative production issue analysis where the workload can be divided.

**Recommendation for your environment:**

- **CCBS/CCDS agile squads:** Ideal for urgent production fixes where multiple team members investigate different parts of the system in parallel.
- **Platform team:** Can be applied when enhancing existing systems or building features that require simultaneous development efforts.

### **Which is Best?**

- **Pairing:** Better for mentoring, complex code issues, and knowledge transfer between two developers.
- **Mobbing:** Best for critical collaborative brainstorming, production outages, and architectural decisions.
- **Swarming:** Best for high-priority parallel tasks that require rapid resolution or development.

Since both Agile teams rotate on production support, **mobbing during high-severity production issues** and **swarming for complex development tasks** would likely be the most effective. Pairing can be reserved for mentoring and bug fixes.

### **Story Selection Guidelines by Collaboration Method**

#### **1. Pairing (Two Developers Working Together)**

**Best for:**

- Complex development tasks requiring precision and continuous review.
- Bug fixes that involve deep knowledge of legacy systems.
- Knowledge transfer and mentorship opportunities.

**Example Stories:**

- Debugging critical production issues.
- Implementing changes in core business logic for CCBS/CCDS applications.
- Developing complex features for credit card services.

---

#### **2. Mobbing (Whole Team Collaborating Simultaneously)**

**Best for:**

- Critical production outages where multiple perspectives are needed quickly.
- Architectural decision-making or designing new application frameworks.
- Major code refactoring tasks involving many interdependent modules.

**Example Stories:**

- High-severity production incident analysis and resolution.
- Architectural redesign or technical spikes for new service implementations.
- Large-scale codebase refactoring or application modernization efforts.

---

#### **3. Swarming (Multiple Team Members Working Independently on a Shared Task)**

**Best for:**

- Urgent tasks that require parallel development efforts.
- Production issues involving investigation across multiple services.
- Large feature development involving different components (backend, frontend, and testing).

**Example Stories:**

- Addressing critical production incidents with parallel investigation tracks (API logs, DB issues, Splunk analysis).
- Developing an end-to-end feature for CCBS/CCDS, where platform and service teams collaborate simultaneously.
- Data migration tasks where multiple modules need concurrent updates.

---

### **Accountability Measures & Pivoting Strategies**

**1. Progress Tracking Measures:**

- **Daily Stand-ups:** Discuss ongoing collaboration tasks and review progress toward story goals.
- **Retrospectives:** Analyze the effectiveness of the chosen collaboration method at the end of each sprint.
- **Collaboration Metrics:**
    - Number of paired/mobbing sessions conducted.
    - Average time spent resolving production issues using collaboration methods.
- **Documentation Updates:** Maintain a knowledge base in Confluence to document lessons learned and key takeaways from collaborative efforts.

**2. Accountability Mechanisms:**

- Assign multiple assignees for stories requiring collaboration to ensure shared responsibility.
- Create ownership guidelines where each task has a primary and secondary owner for effective knowledge sharing.
- Use Jira comments and task updates to document contributions and track story progress.

**3. Pivoting Strategies:**

- **Feedback Loops:** Gather team feedback during retrospectives on the effectiveness of pairing/mobbing/swarming.
- **Performance Metrics:** Compare task completion times before and after implementing a method.
- **Adaptation Plan:**
    - If pairing results in productivity delays, switch to mobbing for critical incidents.
    - If mobbing sessions become chaotic, pivot to swarming for parallel development.
    - If swarming leads to a lack of collaboration, revert to pairing for better focus.

---
### **Impact Assessment for Productivity and Committed Timelines**

**1. Impact Analysis:**

- Assess collaboration time required for each method versus individual task effort.
- Monitor sprint velocity before and after implementing collaborative methods.
- Evaluate production support incident resolution time.

**2. Mitigation Plans for Productivity Loss:**

- Define time-boxed collaboration sessions to prevent excessive time consumption.
- Maintain a buffer in sprint planning for collaborative sessions.
- Identify non-critical tasks that can be deprioritized when collaboration requires more bandwidth.

**3. Reporting Mechanism:**

- Create a dashboard in Jira to visualize task progress and collaboration efficiency.
- Review velocity trends and incident resolution times during sprint reviews to understand impact.
- Share findings with stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for pivoting methods if needed.
